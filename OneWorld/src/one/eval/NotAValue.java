/**
 * Definition of a non-value. Classes that implement this marker
 * interface are internal to the implementation of the evaluator. If
 * the evaluator encounters such an object during evaluation, that is,
 * if a simple expression evaluates to such an object or if an
 * applicable entity's <code>apply()</code> method returns such an
 * object as a value, the evaluator raises a not-a-value exception.
