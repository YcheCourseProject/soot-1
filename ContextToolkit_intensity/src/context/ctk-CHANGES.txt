This file contains the list of changes to the Context Toolkit distribution:

02/10/00: Context Toolkit public distribution created

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

02/24/00: Maintenance update:

1) Addition of the SimpleApp class. This was left out of the original distribution
   by accident. This class is referred to in the installation guide. 

2) Modification of the HTTPServerSocket class. There was some test code that should
   have been commented out before it went in the distribution, so this was fixed.

3) Modification of the Widget class. The update is to deal with the Global Time Clock
   problem listed in the Known Bugs/Problems section of the online tutorial. 

4) Addition of the OffsetThread class to help deal with #3 above. 

5) Addition of the ntp.jar package to help deal with #3 above. ntp.jar is a 3rd party
   jar file that is free to use and distribute under GPL.
